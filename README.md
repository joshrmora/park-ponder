# Park Ponder

John Muir, “The Father of the National Parks,” once exclaimed that going into a forest is to lose your mind and find your soul. But once we come back safely from our travels, how can we make sure that memories are documented?

To ponder is to reflect. One method of reflection can be down in the form of a journal or diary.

Park Ponder is a website for lovers of nature to share reflections on their journeys through the US National Parks.
